# <img width="45" src=pics/armark.png> Retail Food Options on Campus: Are Students Satisfied?


## Introduction

Our team wanted to understand how Aramark makes decisions about retail food offerings on the Baylor University campus and how Baylor students have reacted to those decisions.

We designed the research questions, research hypothesis, surveys, and we collected the data, finally analyzed them and generated the report.
